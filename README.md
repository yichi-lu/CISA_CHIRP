## üßê About

The CISA Hunt and Incident Response Program (CHIRP) is a tool created to
dynamically query Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) on hosts with a single
package, outputting data in a JSON format for further analysis in a SIEM
or other tool. CHIRP does not modify any system data.

The initial IoCs are intended to search for activity
detailed in CISA Alert [AA21-008A](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-008a)
that has spilled into the enterprise environment.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

We build and release CHIRP via
[`Releases`](https://github.com/cisagov/chirp/releases).
However, if you wish to run with Python3.6+, follow these instructions.

You can also write new
[indicators](https://github.com/cisagov/CHIRP/blob/main/indicators/README.md)
or [plugins](https://github.com/cisagov/CHIRP/blob/main/chirp/plugins/README.md)
for CHIRP.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.6 or greater is required to run CHIRP with Python. If you need help
installing Python in your environment, follow the instructions
[here](https://docs.Python.org/3/using/windows.html)

CHIRP must be run on a live machine, but it does not have to be network connected.
Currently, CHIRP must run on the drive containing winevt logs.  Shortly after release,
this will be updated so CHIRP can run from any drive.

### Installing

```console
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

> In our experience, yara-python comes with some other dependencies. You MAY have
to install Visual Studio C++ 14.0 and the Windows 10 SDK, this can be retrieved
with [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
